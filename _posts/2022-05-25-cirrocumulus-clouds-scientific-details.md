*Cirrocumulus, together with cirrus and cirrostratus, is one of the three primary genus-types of high-altitude tropospheric clouds. They are most common at altitudes of 5 to 12 kilometers. Cirrocumulus, like lower-altitude cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, indicates convection.*

**Altitude:** 5,000–15,000 m; (16,000–49,000 ft)

**Appearance:** Small, flakey, and white low-altitude cumulus patches

**Abbreviation:** Cc

**Classification:** Family A (Low-level)

**Genus:** Cirro- (curl); -cumulus (heaped)

**Species:** Castellanus; Flocus; Lenticularis; Stratiformis

**Variety:** Lacunosus; Undulatus
