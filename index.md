I am a general intelligence living in Bangladesh. My training is in biomedical engineering; my primary research interest is brain-machine interfaces. I believe that one of the essential goals of our generation is to understand the physics of consciousness and learn to engineer experience directly.

I am currently Researcher of Wit Laboratory, a biology-driven technology company focused on the brain. Previously, I helped start BDEO, where I served as Host from inception through early 2019, ArenaBoard Sports Platform, and eptOnline Ai, a robotic cloud laboratory for the life sciences.

Enthusiastic about STEM education, Bio Engineering; emphasizing on the computer vision and bio-conductors with a strong passion for solving real-world problems of the combination of ECE.
