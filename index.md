I am a general intelligence. My training is in biomedical engineering; my primary research interest is brain-machine interfaces. I believe that one of the essential goals of our generation is to understand the physics of consciousness and learn to engineer experience directly.

I am currently Researcher of [Wit Laboratory](https://witlab.org), a biology-driven technology company focused on the brain interface machine. Previously, I helped start [Bangladesh Economics Olympiad](https://bdeo.org), where I served as Host/Authorized/Organizer from inception through early 2019, creator of [ArenaBoard Sports Platform](https://github.com/Md-Sanaul-Haque-Shanto/ArenaBoard-Alpha), and English Proficiency Test Online Practice [eptOnline.org](https://eptonline.org) .

Enthusiastic about STEM education, Bio Engineering; emphasizing on the computer vision and bio-conductors with a strong passion for solving real-world problems of the combination of Medical, Electrical, and Computer Science.
